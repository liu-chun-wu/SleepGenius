Create a React UI page with the following layout:

- At the top, a Date Picker (default today) for selecting sleep date
- Below it, a Textarea for typing a question, and a Submit button next to it
- Below that, show:
  - A card displaying overall sleep score and total duration
  - A line chart showing respiration rate over time
  - A bar chart showing sleep stages (deep, light, rem) with time ranges
  - A chatbot response card showing answer, recommendation, and score

Style should be clean, with padding and spacing. Use TailwindCSS.

Create a section in a React + Tailwind interface for uploading a CSV file.

Use a card layout.
Include a title "Upload Sleep CSV".
Add a file input that accepts .csv files.
Include a button labeled "Upload".
Below the upload button, reserve a space to display upload status (e.g., "Uploaded successfully" or error).
Place this card below the chat/question section.
The design should be minimal and fit seamlessly with the rest of a sleep analysis dashboard.
